This repository contains code to simulate a center-based model of cartilage formation and growth. This code was used to generate results and figures for the manuscript "Contributions of cell behavior to geometric order in embryonic cartilage". 


The code is organized as a [user project](https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/wiki/ChasteGuides/UserProjects) for the simulation software [Chaste](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/ "Chaste"). In particular, it works with Chaste version 2019.1.
